# ShiftGeneratorWeb
It is a mini-project of mine written and edited in my spare time. It is currently basic. It was planned in a web version just to be smart. Once the month and year are selected, the website generates shifts biweekly for the various work groups.

This project is a web-based Bi-Weekly Shift Management System designed to simplify the process of scheduling shifts for multiple teams across a selected month. The application allows users to create and manage shifts dynamically for three groups: Acustica, Microfonisti, and Uscieri. It ensures fair distribution of shifts while allowing for exceptions and flexibility.

Key Features:

Dynamic Shift Generation:
Automatically generates shifts for every Tuesday and Saturday of the selected month.
Supports random assignment of members to shifts while ensuring fair distribution.
Group Management:
Allows users to define team members for each group.
Ensures no overlap of the same person in multiple groups on the same day.
Exceptions Handling:
Users can specify members who cannot attend a specific shift via a textarea input.
Skip Turn Functionality:
Includes a checkbox for each shift to completely skip the shift on that day if needed.
Randomized Assignment:
Ensures that shift assignments are randomized while avoiding overlaps or repeated assignments within the same group.
Shift Summary:
Provides a detailed summary at the end showing how many shifts each person was assigned across the month.
Technology Stack:

HTML: For the structure of the web interface.
JavaScript: For handling logic, dynamic content generation, and shift scheduling.
CSS: (optional, can be added for styling).
Use Case:

This system is ideal for teams that need:

A structured yet flexible way to assign shifts.
Customizable handling of exceptions.
Equal and random distribution of responsibilities among team members.
By combining automation with customization, this project eliminates manual scheduling errors and saves time for shift managers.
